    "<p>This quarter, we will focus on the topic of text analytics. Professor Dou and I, along with an army of graduate students, have been working on a specific research question in the text analytics area: if we ask a college student to write a short summary of their weekly reading (the text part), can we (the computer) spot misconceptions/misunderstandings (the analytics part)? I can give you the punch line: it is not easy! We are now into our 4th year on this project.\n",
    "<p>\n",
    "There are two basic approaches to analyzing text. Alternative 1 I'll call knowledge-based. It attempts to use human knowledge of linguistics, sentence structure, word meaning to analyze a piece of text. This is a time-honored approach dating back to the very start of AI in the 1960s. And it is this approach we are using currently for our misconception analysis.\n",
    "<p>The second approach is the new kid on the block. It is statistical and even alien in some ways. There is no attempt to use the knowledge-based approach. Instead, we turn text (words) into data that reflect complicated relationships with each other. We end up with vectors in hundreds and more typically thousands of dimensions. And what analytics method is good at analyzing huge amounts of numeric data? Yep, machine learning and deep learning in particular. So we turn the study of linguistics, creative writing and human communication into big number crunching.\n",
    "<p>\n",
    "I hope this stirs you a bit to say \"Yes, AI conquers all!\" or \"You've now gone too far.\" What I would like to do in this course is at least delve into some intro pieces of the statistical approach. You don't have to agree with the approach. But you should have knowledge of how it works. Given time, we might work in some modules on the knowledge-based approach.\n",

Perhaps it is a better method for the misconception problem we have been working on for 4 years, who knows. Given all this, I cannot promise a polished syllabus. Nor a smooth set of modules that each have just the right amount of content and homework. I'll do my best but it could be bumpy. I had to laugh when a student asked me if they could see my detailed syllabus for the class. I said \"Uh, no. I barely was able to get the course blurb together!\"\n",
